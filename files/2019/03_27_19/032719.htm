						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubleshooting a unique issue I've been having.  Every so often, my screen will go black for about 1-2 seconds and revert back to normal.  It would occur anywhere from 5 minutes apart to every couple hours.  Generally it would happen during WoW and FO76 but has also happened when I was watching anime on Media Player Classic.  I hadn't seen it blank out on any web browsers or idling on the desktop but I imagine I just hadn't witnessed it yet. <i>&#40;&#42;edit&#42; I did witness it on a web browser and the desktop.&#41;</i> Also, it didn't feel load dependent, it wasn't doing this doing this during heavy rendering.  Nothing when I was fighting the Scorchbeast Queen but acted up when I was decorating my house.  I wasn't missing much during the 1-2 second downtime but was probably a sign of things to come...
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First thing I did was update my drivers, but to no avail...  Next was changing the HDMI ports and cords.  Still no luck...  Now things are starting to get worrisome.  My screen is a 42" Visio, that was struck by lightning and I replaced the power supply in it with one I found online for $20.  My computer was randomly restarting last year and it turned out to be the power supply as well, which I replaced with a 300w from my parts graveyard.  Not the brightest of ideas, but it held up for a few months, until this screen blacking happened...  So I have issues from head to toe.  The most likely culprit is the power supply though, and I've already order a <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153233" target="_blank"><b>500w Thermaltake PSU</b></a>.  Not really anything impressive but will definitely suffice.  Thermaltake happens to be one of my favorite brands.  I've been using them for decades at this point.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gaming news, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII" target="_blank"><b>Final Fantasy 7</b></a> was just released for the Nintendo Switch!  Starting development in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, it was riddled with technical difficulties and delays.  Squaresoft opted for the Sony Playstation instead of the Nintendo 64 mostly because of the CD-ROM format.  On January 31, 1997 it was released.  22 years later, it's still hailed as one of the greatest videogames of all time.  Many people will still argue which is the best game in the series.  For me, FF7 remains unparalleled, without question.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dated as the graphics are today, two decades ago it brought the world of <i>Gaia</i> to life.  FF7 was the first in the series to use video cutscenes and 3D models instead of sprites.  The game follows <i>Cloud</i>, an ex-member of <i>SOLDIER</i>, as he joins the <i>AVALANCHE</i> terrorist group opposed to the draining of <i>Gaia's Mako</i> energy by <i>Shinra</i>, a megacorporation bent on world domination.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nostalgia definitely plays a huge role in why I hold this game in such high regard.  Most people who never played this when it first came out will probably have a hard time getting into it.  If you can get past the jarring graphics, the story and cast of characters are top notch.  The english localization had a few quirks as well but doesn't really detract from game too much.  It is a shame that this port isn't a remastered version like <a href="https://captrobau.blogspot.com/2019/01/ff7-remako-hd-graphics-mod-beta-released.html" target="_blank"><b>Remako</b></a> but it's still amazing that after 22 years FF7 returns to Nintendo.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Final Fantasy series is often hit or miss with its games.  Certainly no outright bad games, some just don't tug on the heartstrings nearly as well as others.  <i>Some</i> start at a disadvantage.  Final Fantasy IX and Final Fantasy XII both started on consoles that were ready to be phased out.  They pushed the hardware to its limits and showed us what these dying consoles were capable of, but because everyone was ready for the next system their fame was short-lived.  Nearly every Final Fantasy game has now been ported to newer systems.  Some even transitioned from sprites to models.  This has reinvigorated the love for these games and introduced a few people to games that they didn't get to play in their heyday.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, <i>April 30, 2019</i>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-switch/" target="_blank"><b>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</b></a> followed suit and released on the Nintendo Switch.  I never got to play this on the PS2 when it originally came out but I did fire up the <a href="https://pcsx2.net/" target="_blank"><b>PCSX2</b></a> emulator and try my hand at this classic RPG.  It was <i>jarring</i> to have graphical artifacts break immersion and just never felt right, I always quickly gave up every attempted playthrough.  When I heard it was being released on Steam, I was <i>ecstatic</i>.  After some research I also learned it was coming to the Nintendo Switch, <i>but</i> after a much longer wait...  I opted out of the Steam version because I had, <i>and still have</i>, a large backlog of games and decided I didn't have the time to dedicate to another singleplayer RPG.  My computer is more than a little dated but it still plays games just fine.  My keyboard and mouse are great for nearly any game but I also have a XBox controller and a Steam Controller for those games that don't feel right with a mouse.  On occasion, I end getting a game on Steam and not liking it but the same game on the Switch just seems to <i>'click'</i> for me.  And this seems to be one of those situations.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was <i>completely</i> enthralled from the beginning.  The rendered movies weren't pixelated, the textures were crisp, the music was beautifully composed.  It was <i>so</i> much more immersive than when I tried to play through the emulator that I grinded out the first four hours of the story in one sitting and hardly noticed the time as it flew by.  It felt as nostalgic as the first time I played Final Fantasy VII as a kid.  After the first few tutorial quests it dropped me into the heart of the story and absolutely engrossed me.  I'm doing my best not to ruin any of the plot, even though most people played this over a decade ago, but the urge to gush about characters and events is pretty strong.  I'm nowhere near finishing the game but I have very little to actually write about and this felt noteworthy enough to bring up.  So far, I would highly recommend this game as well as this version of it.

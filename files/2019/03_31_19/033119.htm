						<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/03_31_19/risk_title.jpg" class=mainright /></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/" target="_blank"><b>Risk of Rain 2</b></a> is a roguelike shooter that increases in difficulty as time goes on.  The premise is simple.  Kill enemies, get money, purchase upgrades, guard the teleporter and escape the level.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You start with one character, the <i>Commando</i>, but as you conquer worlds and gain achievements more will quickly become available.  Currently, there are six characters, each with their own unique style and abilities.  However, it's the several dozen types of items you collect in your travels that make <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/" target="_blank"><b>RoR2</b></a> stand out.  You can gain additional jumps, faster attacks or tougher armor, minions and turrets, leeching or exploding bullets, and tons of others.  Every item you find attaches to your character's model like some kind of symbiotic barnacle.  It's really neat to see your character's look evolve through gameplay.  The randomness of the items you acquire and the type of character you choose will make each playthrough a little different from the last, sometimes easier and sometimes harder.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enemies <i>aren't</i> the brightest, but with the variety swarming to annihilate you it'll turn hectic pretty fast.  Ever increasing enemy waves with bigger and badder baddies will have you scrounging for upgrades post haste as you hunt for the exit.  It's a frantic race to survive that'll leave you grinning as it brutally slays the character you thought had transcended mortality and achieved power untold.  The majority of the nasty beasties are from the original, except they're all grown up and 3D now.  It was easy to recognize them and their abilities on my first playthrough and often caught myself gawking at how well they were modeled and animated in this higher dimension.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like it's predecessor, there's a strong sense of the vertical and falling damage is apparent but easily managed.  With the added z-axis, the worlds are sparse and alien, drawing you in to a beautiful landscape.  The maps aren't strictly static designs either.  Each time you play the teleporter will, well, teleport.  There <i>are</i> common locations objects appear but, for the most part, you'll have to search for them.  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/" target="_blank"><b>RoR2</b></a> will have you surveying every nook and cranny looking for previously undiscovered hidey-holes and vantage points for that tactical edge.  I've seen a few clipping issues that'll let you breach the walls of the world to go to places you shouldn't be able to go but the game is still in early access and I'm sure most issues will be more polished in the future.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Apart from some balancing and bugs, this game is magnificent <i>as is</i>.  The original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain/" target="_blank"><b>Risk of Rain</b></a> was an instant favorite for me back when I found it on the Nintendo Switch.  Soon after playing it, I found out there was a sequel in the works, which was making the heroic leap from 2D to 3D.  Not every game can accomplish this transition.  Many classic games fell to the wayside, unable to compete with more complex mechanics or deeper gameplay offered by rival games.  An independent developer making this jump is quite amazing to me.  Their undertaking paid off.  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/" target="_blank"><b>Risk of Rain 2</b></a> just surprised everyone by launching early access.  Offered as a two-for-one deal for the first 48 hours at $20 was <i>well</i> worth the price tag even without the extra copy.

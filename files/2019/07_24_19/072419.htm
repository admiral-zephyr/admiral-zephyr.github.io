						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every gamer has come across a time when there isn't anything interesting to do.  You love a game but the grind has worn you down to the point where you log in and meander around in your favorite game only to log back off shortly.  Maybe you'll go through an install/uninstall spree looking for something.  Maybe you'll go on a gaming haitus and catch up on some shows or work on some projects.  It can be mind-numbing sometimes...  What I have to offer is a couple of free games to try your hand at.  If you haven't tried them before, this might be just the thing you were looking for.
						<hr width=100%>
						<!-- Warframe --><a href="https://www.warframe.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/07_24_19/Warframe.jpg" class=altright /></a>
						<a href="https://www.warframe.com/" target="_blank"><center><h3><b><i>Warframe</i></b></h3></center></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This third-person shooter has some of the most fluid controls I've ever seen.  You play as the <i>Tenno</i>, space-ninjas with advanced suits of combat armor called warframes.  It's set in the far future of our very own solar system with the same familiar planets and moons.  It's the Tenno's responsibility to bring order to this turbulent future with multiple factions vying for power.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gameplay is fast-paced with the majority centered around missions which you can go in solo or with squads of up to four other players.  The missions range from simple extermination of enemies; to defense of a target; to stealthy infiltrations of enemy bases.  Missions take place on different planets with varied environments and each map is beautifully designed. The amount of warframes and weapons the player can craft is just as impressive and the level of customization is mesmerizing.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a great game but it can be easy to lose track of what you should be doing next to progress.  The sheer amount of stuff to do can be a little overwhelming and Warframe is constantly being updated with more and more content.  The game is actively being developed for PC, XBox One, PlayStation 4 and even Nintendo Switch.  Unfortunately crossplay between the systems isn't available.
						<hr width=100%>
						<!-- Path of Exile --><a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/07_24_19/Path_of_Exile.jpg" class=altleft /></a>
						<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/" target="_blank"><center><h3><b><i>Path of Exile</i></b></h3></center></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it might play a lot like Diablo, this game is anything but.  Set in the fantasy world of Wraeclast, you're an exile who has washed up on the shore of brutal continent full of monsters with a dark past full of catastrophes.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first things you'll notice is there is the lack of gold to trade with.  There is none.  All trade is done with the items you find and use throughout your journey.  Next, the abilities you use to fight with are all item based.  Your weapon still does basic attacks but all skills and spells come from gems that you've equipped to your gear.  These gems can be leveled, and improved, and removed, and stored in your stash for later use.  Your character does evolve and grow but through a passive skill tree that all classes share.  The only difference between classes is where you start on the skill tree.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another deep and complex game that requires a bit of research from time to time.  There's even a handy program that will help you with the massive skill tree called <a href="https://github.com/Openarl/PathOfBuilding" target="_blank"><b>Path of Building</b></a>.  The community commonly uses this program to upload and share character builds easily.

						<!-- Maple Story 2 --><a href="http://maplestory2.nexon.net/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/07_24_19/Maple_Story_2.jpg" class=altright /></a>
						<a href="http://maplestory2.nexon.net/" target="_blank"><center><h3><b><i>Maple Story 2</i></b></h3></center></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game plays a bit like Ragnarok Online or Tree of Savior but looks more like Minecraft or Dragon Quest Builders.  It's a grindy MMORPG with a <i>very</i> large anime fanbase, one of the largest I've ever seen.  <i>It can actually be a little cringey to non-weebs sometimes.</i>  It's a light-hearted amusement park of a game with minigames featuring races and quizzes.  You can play casually and explore the massive world, or you can rush to the endgame content and raid challenging bosses.  There's crafting, base building, collecting pets and mounts, and you can even upload your own images and sell your own content to other players.  Special events and holidays are constantly going on.
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's currently eleven classes to choose from, each with their own unique play style and story.  The chibi-styled characters are full of expressions and tell their stories in that uniquely anime sort of way.  There's plenty of dialog but the story can be followed even if you skip it, like most MMOs nowadays.  Overall, if you're looking for something new then you might give this game a try, it might be right up your alley.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> is still one of my favorite time sinks.  I'm <i>not</i> claiming to have any skill in the game but skill doesn't necessarily equate to fun.  It's not exactly the easiest game to get involved with.  The ASCII graphics will make most shy away at first glance, the interface and controls almost require hours of tutorial videos to fully understand, and the game itself can be pretty unforgiving at times.  Overcoming the learning curve to build more and more grandiose settlements is part of what keeps me coming back.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worlds are procedurally generated and can be <i>massive</i>!  Continents with lakes and rivers, mountains and deserts, jungles and swamps, and empires <i>full</i> of dwarves, humans, elves and goblins that rise and fall as time marches ever on.  The history and lore is all procedural as well.  Descriptions of important inhabitants will be etched in tomes and carved on walls.  Legendary weapons and armors will be forged.  Beasts and monsters will roam every inch of the world, from subterranean caves to the skies over the tallest peaks.  <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> really tries it's hardest to paint the most vivid worlds with as much literary detail as possible.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covering <i>everything</i> about this game would be impossible and what I'll be sharing can only scratch the surface.  For now let's look into the basics.  The game can be played vanilla, no mods or addons, and you can get that straight from <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Bay 12 Games</b></a>.  This version is <i>completely</i> ASCII and can be a little daunting to begin with.  The best way to begin <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> is with a starter pack and there are <i>many</i> to choose from, all of which can be found at <a href="http://dffd.bay12games.com/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress File Depot</b></a>.  Meph's pack and PeridexisErrant's pack are Windows flavors and are both great jumping off points.  If you run Linux or Mac OSX, then you can try LinuxLNP <i>(Lazy Newb Pack)</i> or Elpuma's Mac Pack.  All of these will add graphics over the top of the ASCII, as well as add many helpful utilities to better manage the game for you.  For now, let's ignore the extra utilities.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graphics sets are called tilesets and there are <i>several</i> of these to choose from as well.  Meph's starter pack will only include Meph's tileset whereas PeridexisErrant's starter pack will have Meph's and several others such as Spacefox, Phoebus, Obsidian, GemSet and Ironhand.  Ironhand is my personal favorite but it makes little difference which you pick.  Each tileset varies in resolution size.  Meph's is 32x32 pixels, Ironhand is 18x18 pixels and Phoebus is 16x16 pixels.  Having a higher resolution tileset might be more aesthetically pleasing to some people but having a lower resolution doesn't diminish the game either.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These starter packs should be <i>mostly</i> ready out of the box.  Let's fire up the game.  Select <i>'Create New World!'</i> and follow the prompts.  From the creation screen we will have a few options to design the new world.  <i>'World Size'</i>, <i>'History'</i>, <i>'Number of Civilizations'</i>, <i>'Maximum Number of Sites'</i>, <i>'Number of Beasts'</i>, <i>'Natural Savagery'</i> and <i>'Mineral Occurrence'</i>.  You can play with any of these options but <i>'World Size'</i> and <i>'History'</i> will determine how long it takes to generate the world.  A <i>'Large'</i> world with a <i>'Very Long'</i> history will take a lot longer than a <i>'Pocket'</i> world with a <i>'Very Short'</i> history.  If you want a large world with lots of history then be prepared to wait quite a while until it finishes.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you embark on your first settlement, the most difficult part will be learning the controls...  The most important key to remember is <i>'Space'</i>, that will pause the game.  Pressing <i>'Tab'</i> will show and hide the minimap and shortcuts keys.  The <i>arrow keys</i> will let you navigate the X and Y of the map, and <i>'&lt;'</i> and <i>'&gt;'</i> will let you move up and down z-levels.  There's <i>much</i> more to learn but the most common keys you will need will be <i>'d'</i> to set designations like digging and chopping down trees, <i>'b'</i> to place built items, <i>'q'</i> to interact with buildings and <i>'k'</i> to inspect everything occupying a tile.  This should be enough to get you started but the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress Subreddit</b></a> or the <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress Wiki</b></a> woud be a good place to learn more.

						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kruggsmash/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/04_17_19/kruggsmash.jpg" class=altright /></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good place to see <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> in action would be a youtuber by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kruggsmash/" target="_blank"><b>Kruggsmash</b></a>.  He started off by drawing scenes from <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> and it kind of evolved into weekly half-hour episodes.  It's mostly gameplay footage but he adds hand-drawn animations and narrates the adventures of dwarven settlements.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kruggsmash/" target="_blank"><b>Kruggsmash</b></a> has been uploading youtube videos for 5 years and you can see how much he's improved over the years, going from MS Paint to actual drawings.  Not just the art but the whole production value has increased and looks <i>very</i> professional.  This man has me on the edge of my seat <i>every</i> week.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His latest in the series is the dwarven fortress of Honeystoker.  Without divulging any spoilers, the projects he has his dwarves constructing continues to amaze even though they're not always flawless creations.  The mishaps and sidetracks that come about as he prototypes are caused by his own hubris and the general randomness of <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> itself.  And this brings the worlds to life as he blames the little drunken bastards for their poor planning.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kruggsmash/" target="_blank"><b>Kruggsmash</b></a> isn't trying to min/max the situations.  He's having fun and trying to share that fun with his audience, it's really quite admirable.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> started development in 2002 and now it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank"><b>Steam</b></a> and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank"><b>itch.io</b></a>!  <i>Sort of</i>.  The basic game, <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress <i>Classic</i></b></a> as it's being called, will still be free and updates will continue for the foreseeable future.  The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank"><b>Steam</b></a> and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank"><b>itch.io</b></a> versions will provide a modded version of the game with a custom tileset and new music as well as automatic updates and Steam Workshop support.  The premium version of the game is being developed by <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank"><b>Kitfox Games</b></a>, modders of the classic version, namely the people behind the Mayday and Meph tilesets.  The new music is being composed by <a href="https://www.dabuaudio.com/" target="_blank"><b>Dabu</b></a>.  The full details can be read on the official faqs.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This <i>alternative version</i> will most likely be a boon for the game and it's community as a whole.  Tarn <i>'Toady One'</i> Adams and Zach <i>'Threetoe'</i> Adams are supporting development of <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> entirely through donations and having access to wider crowd of gamers could support them further.  The faqs state no one bought or sold anything, and ownership of <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> has not changed.  <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank"><b>Kitfox Games</b></a> will receive a portion ofthe revenue from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank"><b>Steam</b></a> and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank"><b>itch.io</b></a> to support the development of the new assets and launching the game.  It is a <i>little</i> unnerving to see a beloved game branch out like this but I'm thankful it didn't get straight up sold or stolen.  From what I've seen, all parties involved are on friendly terms and there isn't <i>any</i> evidence <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><b>Dwarf Fortress</b></a> will suffer any negative consequences.  All in all, I'm just glad to see more people have the opportunity to try this <i>amazing</i> game, some for the very first time.

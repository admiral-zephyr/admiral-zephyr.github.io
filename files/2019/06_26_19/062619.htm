						<i><b><q>Political correctness is America's newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance.  It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people's language with strict codes and rigid rules.  I'm not sure that's the way to fight discrimination.  I'm not sure silencing people or forcing them to alter their speech is the best method for solving problems that go much deeper than speech.</q></b></i>

						<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/06_26_19/vivian.png" class=mainright /></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outrage machine is still running.  Redlining for years now but showing no signs of stopping.  Being politically correct has been a trend for decades now, subtly stealing words from the cultural lexicon.  Being offended on the behalf of others is the fashionable way to signal your virtue and show your superiority over everyone else.  And it's not just words anymore.  Memes are being recognized as hate-speech and people are being banned for using the 'okay' hand sign.  Crocodile tears have become weaponized against the masses and it's an ideological arms race to the bottom.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, how did I get started talking politics?  Video games.  They have been demonized ever since their inception by nearly every group imaginable.<sup><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_controversies" target="_blank">[1]</a></b></sup>  There have been claims that video games cause violence, claims of misogyny and racism, and claims of addiction and health related issues, just to name a few.  Gamers have been fighting back for decades and the modern era is no different.
						<hr>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/gamergate" target="_blank"><b>Gamergate</b></a> was born roughly around August 16th, 2014, when Eron Gjoni<sup><b><a href="https://ggwiki.deepfreeze.it/index.php?title=Eron_Gjoni" target="_blank">[2]</a></b></sup> posted an article about his ex-girlfriend, Zoe Quinn.<sup><b><a href="https://ggwiki.deepfreeze.it/index.php?title=Zoe_Quinn" target="_blank">[3]</a></b></sup>  He wrote about her infidelity and manipulative nature but, most importantly, covered the suspected cronyism and conflicts of interest around her game, Depression Quest.<sup><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_Quest" target="_blank">[4]</a></b></sup>  While the game wasn't anything special, it did spark the creation of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/" target="_blank"><b>/r/KotakuInAction</b></a>, the subreddit of the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/gamergate" target="_blank"><b>Gamergate</b></a> movement.  Game journalists were under scrutiny for unethical behavior.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journalists and social justice bloggers began writing about misogyny and sexism in the gaming community, stating Zoe Quinn was a victim and condemning <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/gamergate" target="_blank"><b>Gamergate</b></a> as an internet hate group.  There was a smear campaign of hit pieces released in unison, all attacking gamers and all making the same talking points.  Soon after, there was a leak of mailing lists, group members and email conversations called GameJournoPros<sup><b><a href="https://ggwiki.deepfreeze.it/index.php?title=GameJournoPros" target="_blank">[5]</a></b></sup>.  This was the evidence <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/gamergate" target="_blank"><b>Gamergate</b></a> needed.  It showed proof of collusion, corruption and censorship against the gaming community.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wikipedia started locking articles as back and forth changes took place on every page involving this controversy.  Anyone pro-Gamergate was ridiculed and banned from every debate and convention.  Death threats, doxxing and swatting became commonplace.  The current political climate and many prominent names we see today are a direct result of the events that transpired in the gaming community these last five years.  And it's still continuing...
						<hr>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics have been invading our games.  Rumor has it World of Warcraft has added any mention of the Hong Kong protests to it's list of banned words.<sup><b><a href="/files/2019/06_26_19/wow_chat.png" target="_blank">[6]</a></b></sup>  There's more rumors that Cyberpunk 2077 is being targeted by media collusion.<sup><b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/c3sbdi/discussion_are_gaming_companies_behind_cyberpunk/" target="_blank">[7]</a></b></sup>  And it's not just video games being targeted, all sorts of nerdy entertainment is on the chopping block.  It sounds very alarmist, on par with conspiracy theories...  The best thing you can do is research and keep an open mind.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a <i>very</i> off topic post I wrote but I had little to write about and kind of felt it deserved some attention.  Not everything I cover can be bright and cheery, sometimes I'll have to write about the shady stuff I see as well.  This is hardly the final word, I can be wrong too.  Everything I write is opinion for my own amusement and the best I can do is add links to what I find.  Maybe I'll write a follow up some day, kind of a hindsight article.  Kind of amazing I can publish myself for next to nothing honestly.  Good luck in the future!

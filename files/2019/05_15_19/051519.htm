						<a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/05_15_19/Fallout76.png" class=mainright /></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always been a fan of Fallout.  My first taste of the wasteland was with a demo CD from PC Gamer, <i>back when Coconut Monkey was their mascot.</i>  The demo featured a little New California town called the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scrapheap" target="_blank"><b>Scrapheap</b></a>, which was never shown outside the demo.  I would eventually end up buying <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 1</b></a>, <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout_2" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 2</b></a> and <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout_Tactics" target="_blank"><b>Fallout: Tactics</b></a>.  I never got to play <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout:_Brotherhood_of_Steel" target="_blank"><b>Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel</b></a>, <i>but I've heard I didn't miss much anyways.</i>  This was going to be the last of the Fallout universe for a while...  <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Van_Buren" target="_blank"><b>Project Van Buren</b></a> was a glimmer of hope, <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Van_Buren" target="_blank"><b>Fallout~3</b></a>, but not as we know it.  Rumors and the odd screenshot were all we got for a very long while though.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wouldn't receive another Fallout until Bethesda acquired the rights, and <i>everyone</i> was overjoyed with <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 3</b></a> in all it's glory.  The universe kept expanding with numerous DLCs.  <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout:_New_Vegas" target="_blank"><b>Fallout: New Vegas</b></a> and it's DLCs were next.  Both of these games were a little rough at launch and had serious bugs late in the main quests, both of which would be fixed.  <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout_4" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 4</b></a> changed the recipe a little bit and gave us the ability to construct buildings and settlements.  The reviews were a <i>little</i> mixed but the DLCs would add enough content to make this game a success overall.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 76</b></a> was announced, as a <i>Survival Online RPG</i>...  Even <i>I</i> initially hated the idea.  We were told the <i>only</i> human characters in the game would be other players.  A sense of dread began to wash over me, <i>this</i> wasn't what I wanted at all...  Luckily a friend gave me a beta invite and I got to try it out firsthand.  The <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/XUtJrgiCgU6WqMASW8w0I/fallout-76-our-future-begins-together-in-beta" target="_blank"><b>B.E.T.A.</b></a> <i>(Break-it Early Test Application)</i> was about a week on XBOX and then about a week on PS4 and PC.  It was a general stress test for customers who preordered the game.  There was frequent disconnects and other bugs.  Nothing too amazing happened, pretty standard beta, everyone expected as much.
						<hr>
						<a href="/files/2019/05_15_19/FO76_Roadmap.png" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/05_15_19/Roadmap01_WildAppalachia_ss.png" class=altleft /></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 14, 2018 <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 76</b></a> launched...  A <i>slew</i> of problems collided.  It was one of <i>the</i> roughest videogame launches I have <i>ever</i> seen, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 76</b></a> and it's community have witnessed one <i>hell</i> of a roller coaster these last six months.  Substandard merchandise was being sold after showing customers higher quality goods on at least two occasions.<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44432/~/why-did-i-receive-a-different-bag-than-expected-with-the-fallout-76-power-armor" target="_blank"><b><sub>(1)</sub></b></a><a href="https://www.slashgear.com/fallout-76-nuka-dark-rum-the-truth-about-glass-31559616/" target="_blank"><b><sub>(2)</sub></b></a>  <i>Multiple</i> game-breaking bugs reared their ugly heads, and not just in side quests.  The market for duplicated items was <i>rampant</i> and breaking the in-game economy.  It was a <i>nightmare</i> for everyone involved.  The backlash caused the games sales to plummet and it was heavily discounted merely a <i>week</i> after launch.  There was even a bug that caused the game to uninstall itself!  The first few <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patches" target="_blank"><b>patches</b></a> did little to appease this great and angry beast of a game.  They were huge, nearly 50gb <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patches" target="_blank"><b>patches</b></a>.  I had to move the game to a spare drive to patch it and move it <i>back</i> to my SSD.  It was all very irritating and the gaming press ate it up.  A flurry of clickbait articles followed each and every patch to join in the ridicule.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game has started to <i>slowly</i> regain its footing.  Everyone who purchased a collector's edition was able to replace their shoddy nylon bag with the promised canvas bag.  The most notable of bugs and exploits received needed attention.  The community began working to give suggestions and critiques, and the developers listened and gave more transparent notes to <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patches" target="_blank"><b>patches</b></a>.  The always-on microphone was given a push-to-talk, respeccing you character's perks was now possible, and we gained double the stash space.  A new issue looming was the lack of content, the players had burned through everything to do...
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethesda published a 100-day development <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019" target="_blank"><b>roadmap</b></a>, broken into seasons, to show players content was in the works.  So far we've seen the seasonal Fasnacht event, which I already briefly covered.  We've rediscovered the lost art of alcohol brewing and learned to hunt our fellow vault dwellers in <i>'Survival Mode'</i>.  We tracked down the mysterious Sheepsquatch and the events surrounding the disappearance of Calvin Lowe.  We found and completed a bucket list and became master photographers with our own cameras.  We rose through the ranks of the Pioneer Scouts from Tadpole to Possum and learned to craft our own backpacks.  And <i>now</i> we've met the Purveyor, a way to break down our legendary gear and try our luck at new pieces to add to our collections.
						<hr>
						<a href="/files/2019/05_15_19/Photo76Base.png" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/05_15_19/Photo76Base_ss.png" class=altright /></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wild Appalachia wave of content patches has concluded and next we have Nuclear Winter.  Not everything is known about this next wave of content yet.  We do know this will include a new game mode, <i>'Nuclear Winter'</i>, as well as more end game content.  Two vault raids will be opening to provide more challenges, <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_96" target="_blank"><b>Vault 96</b></a> and <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_94" target="_blank"><b>Vault 94</b></a>.  Little is known about <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_96" target="_blank"><b>Vault 96</b></a> yet.  Players can see the exterior and some have glitched inside but everything has yet to be set up and there is very little information or lore available.  <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_94" target="_blank"><b>Vault 94</b></a> on the other hand has quite a bit of lore released already, <i>though no definitive information on the raid.</i>  In the Mire there are orangish vines covering nearly tree and building in the area.  The way the plants have grown seems to suggest it was almost explosively quick and caught most people and animals off guard.  This is where those plants originated...
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legendary players is the last feature hinted at in the <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019" target="_blank"><b>roadmap</b></a> currently released.  With the huge number of characters over level 100, a prestige system will reinvigorate players with a fresh goal.  Resetting characters and gaining more powerful abilities is pretty vague though.  Hopefully they won't feel as weak as a fresh character.  I played a lowbie character recently and the weakness was very obvious.  Running from enemies instead of chasing them to bring down my sword on their skulls was a minor issue compared to the lack of a marsupial mutation.  Having access to resources and learned plans will help keep our heads above water <i>unless</i> our characters are severely gimped by the newfound legendary status.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having witnessed the game since a little before launch, I'm pretty comfortable in assuming the developers have the game's best interest at heart.  <i>Maybe not the marketing team though...</i>  Not everyone will like every change, that's just the nature of an evolving online game.  The majority of players have stuck it out and many continue to return.  The developers have taken this in stride and continue to learn from mistakes.  I was concerned when I first heard about <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 76</b></a> but now I'm convinced this is the next step in the Fallout series.  Fearing the jump from singleplayer to multiplayer was just the same as the jump from the old 2D style of Fallout 1 &amp; 2 to the current 3D style of Fallout 3 &amp; 4.  <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/" target="_blank"><b>Fallout 76</b></a> carries with it the true spirit of the Fallout series.

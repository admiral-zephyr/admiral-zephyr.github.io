						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring's here again.  Crazy winds blew away the cold weather and people are heading out to find the wonders of nature.  They'll be met with allergies and insects, and soon be miserable as the weather heats up for summer, wishing winter would hurry up.  Even with all the irritations, this is the greatest time of year.  Not being limited to indoor projects is a boon.  Grow some veggies, work on the car, watch the sunset and have a beer.
						<hr>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started doing this website project as a way to force myself to start writing more, I've probably stated that before, and it's definitely shown me how much effort it takes to write meaningful content.  Very little feels topic worthy, even with such a broad range of topics I try following.  I'm actually writing this three days after the date posted because I was staying busy with day to day tasks, getting distracted or just plain had very little to write about.
						<hr>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past couple weeks I've been sticking to World of Warcraft, just to log in and half-assedly keep my main character caught up, and Fallout 76.  There's still a dark cloud hanging over FO76.  I have a good time roaming the wasteland but no one can deny the game has been plagued with issues, most of which could have been easily avoided.  This pattern seems to continue for the time being.  Last I read, the developers were planning to release a more PVP oriented game mode, <i>survival</i>, but allowing characters to transfer from the original game mode, <i>adventure</i>.  The issue is, these characters from adventure mode have been exploited.  Infinite carry weight and duplicating rare items.  The development team has fixed most exploits and banned many cheaters but not all.  Starting fresh characters would have made more sense and the majority of the remaining community agrees with this sentiment.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fasnacht is Fallout 76's current and first holiday event.  The ingame event takes place in Helvetia, a little town southeast of Vault 76.  After talking to the Master of Ceremonies, the event will have you help a random assortment of robots.  Harvesting eggs, hanging decorations and collecting steins are a few of the tasks that will need completed.  Afterwards, you defend the robots as they parade through town.  During which you kill a wave of frogs, a wave of super mutant suiciders, and finally a wave of bugs and wolfs with one legendary sloth.  Nearly every event I witnessed had about a dozen players chipping in so it usually takes about 10-15 minutes.  The word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasnacht_(doughnut)" target="_blank"><b>fasnacht</b></a> actually translates to donut but it is also a real life event that takes place in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, as well as the town of Helvetia, just like in FO76.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than Fasnacht, Fallout just introduced brewing.  Doing a short quest will award you with the plans to make your own crafting stations.  While Biv is a great new character, it feels like could have just added the alcohol recipes to the already existing cooking station...  The new craftable drinks give bonuses just like the current food and drinks but the new Nukashine drink will cause your character to blackout and will teleport you to a random location.  This random location has already warped people into future content and may be used for other exploits.  Brewing has also caused server stability and decay issues.  At the end of the day, it's still great to have new content, even if it is a little buggy...

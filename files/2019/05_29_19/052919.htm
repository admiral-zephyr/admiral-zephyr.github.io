						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if backlogs of games weren't a big enough issue, there's also magnitudes of games that I never got to play in their glory days or games I'd like to replay and relive the nostalgia.  It can be more than a little difficult to play them in their original format.  Getting original consoles or computers from 20-30 years ago would be near impossible for most people.  The vast majority of companies from that time aren't even around anymore and the ones that made it don't have any kind of support for these old systems.  Luckily, many enthusiasts started archiving these classic games in digital formats.  Since no one holds copyrights anymore, or does little to enforce those copyrights, the term '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware" target="_blank"><b>Abandonware</b></a>' came to fruition.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware" target="_blank"><b>Abandonware</b></a> is a legally gray area that broadly defines software that has been abandoned and there's is a multitude of ways that can happen.  Obsolete hardware support, lack of purchasable sources or the creator simply going out of business are among the most common.  Important historic milestones in software development have actually become lost forever...  When the orginal Atari headquarters was closed, the source code for Asteroids, Centipede and many others was actually thrown out with the garbage.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware#cite_ref-atari2_15-0" target="_blank"><b><sub>(1)</sub></b></a>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_image" target="_blank"><b>ROMs</b></a> are in a even grayer area...  Many of the console games are actively republished on newer generations of hardware.  The general rule for console games is if you own the original, physical game then having a digital '<i>backup</i>' is your legal loophole.  It's <i>suggested</i> you rip the game straight from the cartridge or disc to make your '<i>backup</i>' but that can be more than a little challenging.  Other means of acquisition are how most people do this but it is technically frowned upon.
						<hr>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware" target="_blank"><b>abandonware</b></a> is pretty simple.  There are many communities dedicated to sharing and hosting space for these classics.  Because of the questionable nature and poor documentation involved, some of these sites can sometimes feel a little shady and you should use common sense when downloading and running software from unknown sources...  An english game doesn't usually have chinese or russian characters for filenames.  There probably won't be an installer program, it will more than likely be a zip folder.  Just be weary in general.  Some of my old preferred sites are <a href="https://vimm.net/" target="_blank"><b>Vimm</b></a> and <a href="http://www.abandonia.com/" target="_blank"><b>Abandonia</b></a>.  There's also the <a href="http://www.abandonwarering.com/" target="_blank"><b>AbandonwareRing</b></a>, a self-regulated group of websites devoted to maintaining classic games.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nintendo's Switch has a selection of classic NES games and even has limited edition versions that never made it overseas.  It is available with Nintendo's online <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/pricing/" target="_blank"><b>subscription</b></a>, about $20 per year and is one of the cheaper services for consoles.  I know PlayStation has a selection of older games for sale and I presume Xbox does as well, but well, I'm a little bit of a Nintendo fanboy and rarely get anything but Nintendo consoles.  Having a PC and Nintendo consoles is the best option for the widest selection of games in my opinion and I don't really have the money to keep up with every game.  Sorry, that's just how it is...
						<hr>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the game or system it originated on, setup of the emulators can vary in difficulty...  A Xbox controller is pretty universal but you can also find USB versions of the original system's controllers.  Some knowledge of DOS is handy for setting up older PC games.  The narrower the niche of the game and the more difficult it will be to play usually.  It also depends on how close to the original experience you want.  Playing a SNES game on a PC with a Xbox controller is one of the simpler set ups but I've seen people make arcade cabinets with libraries of systems and games.  A simple Google search for '<i>abandonware</i>' or '<i>emulators</i>' is all it takes to start.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However you prefer to play just remember the time and effort it took to develop these games and do your best to support the people that keep these masterpieces alive.  Buy your favorite games being ported.  Spread the word about how much you loved a certain game from ages ago.  Or donate games or systems you have and don't use anymore.

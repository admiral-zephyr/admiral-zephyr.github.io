						<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/files/2019/08_14_19/wow_ss.gif" class=mainleft /></a>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><b>World of Warcraft</b></a> launched on November 23<sup><u>rd</u></sup>, 2004, and at this point, there really isn't anyone who <i>hasn't</i> heard of it.  <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><b>WoW</b></a> was a little bit of a dark horse when it was first announced.  At the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest" target="_blank"><b>Everquest</b></a> was the leading MMORPG and there was a handful of others, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online" target="_blank"><b>Ultima Online</b></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Age_of_Camelot" target="_blank"><b>Dark Age of Camelot</b></a>.  <i>Blizzard</i> had experience with multiplayer games because of <i>Battle.net</i> hosting games for <i>Diablo</i>, <i>Starcraft</i> and <i>Warcraft</i>, but having thousands of players actively participating in one world would be a feat.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When news of Blizzard's new MMORPG first started spreading, I was only mildly interested myself.  I loved the Diablo games and dabbled in some of the others but the idea of <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><b>World of Warcraft</b></a> didn't really draw me in.  Slowly, as more and more information came out, I found myself looking forward to playing and would research which race and class I wanted to start off as.  Signing up for the closed beta did me little good but I did manage to play the final open beta.  Instead of the <i>Night Elf Druid</i> I was planning on, I tried a <i>Night Elf Hunter</i>.  It was amazingly polished for a beta and I was mesmerized as I explored every nook and cranny of <i>Teldrassil</i>, the Night Elf starting area.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the one <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><b>World of Warcraft</b></a> launch I missed.  I didn't get a copy until the middle of December.  It was the last box on the shelf and I ended up sharing the account with my two other friends so we could all play.  We all started on the Alleria server as Alliance and I picked a <i>Night Elf Hunter</i> again because of the fond memories of the game that I had in the beta.  Playing all through Christmas break, I eventually had to go back to college.  Even though I reached level 40-something, all of my other friends at college had started on the Hellscream server and played Horde.  So to play with them I had to start over on this new server...  This was pretty common when <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><b>WoW</b></a> first launched.  Any time you would meet someone in real life that played, you would state your faction and server.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting fresh on a new server would be a chore but I did it anyways and rolled a <i>Troll Rogue</i>.  This time I slowed down my levelling and with this stealthy rogue I was able to explore unimpeded by monsters.  I would end up level 30-40 for about a year since I was never much of a hardcore player and there was <i>so</i> much to do in <i>Azeroth</i>.  Hopping from guild to guild, I eventually hit the max level at the time of 60.  In August of 2006, I founded the <i>Carpe Noctem</i> guild, which is still active to this day.  Though I founded it, I don't consider myself much of a leader and passed the role to a more responsible person soon afterwards.  The title of <i>Guild Master</i> has been handed down to the next ever since.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the same nostalgic experiences you hear about from other veteran WoW players, raiding Tarren Mill for fun, toxic Barrens chat, Alterac Valley battleground lasting days, and the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj locking up the server.  Staying up late and being too drunk to raid are some of my fondest memories of this game.  Unfortunately, none of the original members remain.  That's just what time does.  Moves on.  
						<hr>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade" target="_blank"><b><i>Burning Crusade</i></b></a> <i>&#40;January 16<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2007&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first WoW expansion introduced us to two new races, the <i>Draenei</i> and the <i>Blood Elves</i>.  The level cap was increased to level 70, added flying mounts and it also let <i>Paladins</i> play on Horde and <i>Shamans</i> play on Alliance.  A new profession, <i>Jewelcrafting</i>, was added.  There was also the new Eye of the Storm battleground, world pvp events, and 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 arenas.  A new zone, Outland, gave WoW a little bit of a science fiction vibe and many people started referring to the Draenei as 'Space Goats'.  The expansion was well-received and brought many more players to the game.
						<hr>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King" target="_blank"><b><i>Wrath of the Lich King</i></b></a> <i>&#40;November 13<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2008&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second expansion gave us a new class, the <i>Death Knights</i>.  They were everywhere...  You couldn't find a dungeon group, raid or battleground without at least one person playing Death Knight.  The level cap was increased to level 80 and another new zone was added, this time as the continent of Northrend, home of the Lich King.  Another profession was added, <i>Inscription</i>.  A new type of pvp was added, <i>Wintergrasp</i>, where the whole area was designed specifically for pvp.  Every two and a half hours a new battle between the Alliance and Horde would break out.  The winners from the last fight would control the fortress where the entrance to a short pve raid would take place.  The losers from the previous match would be on offense, smashing walls with siege weapons and trying to overtake the fortress's current owners.  This was another great expansion for many people and added to WoW's fame.
						<hr>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm" target="_blank"><b><i>Cataclysm</i></b></a> <i>&#40;December 7<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2010&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the third expansion, WoW was starting to show it's age.  It not only added two more races, the <i>Goblins</i> and the <i>Worgen</i>, but also reforged the world in Deathwing's fire.  Outland, Northrend and everything those expansions introduced remained the same but all other zones were redesigned.  There was no new continent this time but new zones were added to the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor.  Flying was added to every zone except the Draenei and Blood Elf starting zones.  <i>Archaeology</i> was added as a secondary profession and the level cap was increased to 85.  Even though <i>Cross Realm</i> grouping was added, compared to the previous expansions this one was a little mediocre for players.
						<hr>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Mists_of_Pandaria" target="_blank"><b><i>Mists of Pandaria</i></b></a> <i>&#40;September 25<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2012&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth expansion, they added the <i>Pandaren</i> race and the <i>Monk</i> class.  The new Pandarens started neutral but could later choose between the Alliance or Horde.  <i>Challenge Mode</i>, <i>Scenarios</i> and <i>Flex Raids</i> were introduced but what really blew everyone away was <i>Pet Battling</i>.  Another continent was added, <i>Pandaria</i>, as well as several smaller islands, and the level cap was increased to 90.  This expansion was a step up from the last one and brought many fresh players to the game.
						<hr>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Warlords_of_Draenor" target="_blank"><b><i>Warlords of Draenor</i></b></a> <i>&#40;November 13<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2014&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth expansion is often considered the least entertaining...  Increasing the level cap to 100 and adding player housing called <i>Garrisons</i> did little to keep players around for the whole expansion.  New mechanics, like followers and random item upgrades, started here.  <i>Draenor</i> is the new continent this time and it's based on what the Outland would look like in an alternate timeline basically.  No new classes or races were added in this expansion though they did update some models of the original races.  Overall, this expansion was mediocre as well.
						<hr>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion" target="_blank"><b><i>Legion</i></b></a> <i>&#40;August 30<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2016&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was ready for the sixth expansion to start.  The level cap increased to 110 this time and the <i>Demon Hunter</i> class was added.  Garrisons became <i>Order Halls</i> based upon class and players were given upgradeable <i>Artifact Weapons</i> based upon their class specialization.  Mythic+ dungeons were introduced as a way to scale dungeons past normal, heroic and mythic difficulties.  The <i>Broken Isles</i>, and later <i>Argus</i>, are the new areas this time.  This expansion brought everyone back to the game and was quite entertaining in general.
						<hr>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Battle_for_Azeroth" target="_blank"><b><i>Battle for Azeroth</i></b></a> <i>&#40;August 14<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2018&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we're on the seventh expansion.  The current level cap is 120 and <i>Allied Races</i> have been added, a kind of subrace of the classic races.  Adding <i>Void Elves</i>, <i>Lightforged Draenei</i>, <i>Dark Iron Dwarves</i> and <i>Kul Tiran Humans</i> for the Alliance, and <i>Nightborne Elves</i>, <i>Highmountain Tauren</i>, <i>Mag'har Orcs</i> and <i>Zandalari Trolls</i> for the Horde.  Instead of having a shared continent, this expansion gives each faction their own.  The Alliance receive <i>Kul Tiras</i> and the Horde gets <i>Zandalar</i>.  Factions aren't restricted to their own continent but encouraged to invade and set up bases in enemy territory.  The new <i>Warfronts</i> are a kind of pve battleground and <i>Island Expeditions</i> are a kind of replacement to Scenerios.  The <i>Nazjatar</i> and <i>Mechagon</i> zones have been added as well.  Since this expansion is ongoing and I'm coming back from haitus, it's a little difficult to sum up this expansion but it's been pretty good so far.

						<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic" target="_blank"><b><i>World of Warcraft Classic</i></b></a> <i>&#40;August 27<sup><u>th</u></sup>, 2019&#41;</i>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been almost fifteen years since the original <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><b>World of Warcraft</b></a> launched and now we're getting a <i>remastered</i> version.  Rumored to start at <a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0" target="_blank"><b>patch 1.12</b></a>, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic" target="_blank"><b><i>WoW Classic</i></b></a> will be doled out in phases starting with <i>Molten Core</i>, <i>Onyxia</i> and <i>Maraudon</i>.  There will be no honor system yet but pvp just for fun will be possible.  There aren't many details out yet but Blizzard has allowed reserving names to prepare for launch.  The game should function just like it did back in the day, bugs and all, with few modern comforts patched in.  Luckily, it won't be a seperate subscription fee and anyone with an active <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank"><b>WoW</b></a> subscription will have access.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a huge nostalgia factor at play here but how well will modern gamers acclimate to the days of yore?  What lacking feature will torture us the most?  There's a lot of people prepared to have a go at it again but there will be a very niche audience that sticks around for more than a month.  I've already thrown my hat into the ring and reserved my name but I'm not certain how long I'll stick with it.
